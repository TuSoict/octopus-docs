## Stake OCT

To become a validator of Appchain, you need to stake OCT.

> **Note**: 
>
> * The validator's NEAR account should have a few NEAR tokens and enough OCT tokens for the staking.
> * For the test network, please request OCTs from the [Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.oct.network/).

Go to the [Octopus Network Testnet](https://testnet.oct.network/), click the `Appchains` tab and follow the steps:

1. Select Appchain you wish to stake for, and click `Stake`;
2. In the pop-up window, enter your `Validator ID` and `Staking Amount`, and click `Stake`.

`Validator ID` is the validator's appchain account, it is a SS58 address generated in the step [Generate Validator Account](./validator-generate-keys.md).
