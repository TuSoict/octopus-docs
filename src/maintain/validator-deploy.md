## Deploy Validator Node

Octopus Network provides a one-click deploy service of validator nodes. Optionally, validator node operators can also [deploy and run it manually](./validator-deploy-manually.md).

> **About the hardware configuration**
>
> * In the test network, our one-click deployment tool uses the AWS EC2 instance **t3.small**, the default configuration is 2 core, 2G, 80G SSD. If you manually set up your validator node, you could refer to this configuration.

### Automatically Deploy

**Note**: Currently, the auto-deployment tool only supports deploying validator nodes to AWS server.

Go to the Octopus Apps ([Mainnet](https://mainnet.oct.network) and [Testnet](https://testnet.oct.network)), select `Appchains` Tab ->  the corresponding appchain, follow the steps to deploy:

1. Click `Deploy Tool`, in the pop-up window, select `Deploy Node`;

![deploy node](../maintain/validator_deploy_node.jpg)

2. In the pop-up window, enter your `AWS Access Key` and click `Enter`;

![deploy login](../maintain/validator_deploy_login.jpg)

3. Click `Deploy New`, and then select `Base Image` and click `Deploy`;

![deploy new](../maintain/validator_deploy_new.jpg)

4. After deployment initialization, click `Apply`, and then in the pop-up window, enter your `AWS Access Secret` and click `Apply`;

![deploy apply](../maintain/validator_deploy_apply.jpg)

**Note**: `AWS Access Secret` will only be used for this deployment and wouldn't be stored anywhere.

5. The deployment process lasts about 3-5 minutes, and then refresh the page to check the status, the successful deployment is as shown in the figure below. Record the login information of the instance and click the `RSA` to download the ssh key file.

### Check the synchronization of the validator node

The validator node must complete the synchronization of the chain data. 

1. Log in to the AWS instance;

```bash
ssh -i <Path of the id_rsa file> ubuntu@<IP address of AWS instance>
```

2. Check the docker logs of validator;

```bash
docker logs seashell
```

whether there is an similar output as the following:

**Note**: Login to the AWS server with the downloaded ssh key file, if you encounter an error `Permissions 0644 for 'id_rsa' are too open`, please execute the following command:

```bash
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
