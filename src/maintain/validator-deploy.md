## Deploy Validator Node

Octopus Network provides a one-click deploy service of validator nodes. Optionally, validator node operators can also [deploy and run it manually](./validator-deploy-manually.md).

### Automatically Deploy

**Note**: Currently, the auto-deployment tool only supports deploying validator nodes to AWS server.

Go to the [Octopus Network Testnet](https://testnet.oct.network/), select `Appchains` Tab ->  the corresponding appchain, follow the 2 steps to deploy:

1. Click `Deploy Validator`;
2. In the pop-up window, enter your `AWS Access Key` and click `Enter`;

As shown below:

![deploy validator](../maintain/validator_deploy.jpg)

![deploy new](../maintain/validator_deploy_new.jpg)

**Note**: `AWS Access Key` will only be used for this deployment and wouldn't be stored anywhere.
