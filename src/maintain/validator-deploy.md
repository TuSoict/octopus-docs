## Deploy validator node

Octopus Network provides a one-click-deploy service for the validator node. It is designed to simplify the deployment process of the validator node, but it is not the only method. Validator node operators can also [deploy and run it manually](./validator-deploy-manually.md).

### Automatically deploy

**Note**: Currently only supports deploying validator node to AWS server.

Go to the Octopus network, [testnet](https://testnet.oct.network/), select Appchain Tab page, click Appchain to enter the operation page and complete the following 2 steps:

1. In the operation page, click `Deploy Validator`;
2. In the pop-up page, enter your `AWS Access Key` and click `Enter`;

As shown below:

**Note**: `AWS Access Key` will only be used for this deployment and the `AWS Secret Key` wouldn't be stored anywhere, so the account is very low risk.
