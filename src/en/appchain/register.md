## Register your Appchain

Appchain team provided needed information to the Octopus network, and used its NEAR account to send a registration transaction to the relay contract in the Octopus network to complete the Appchain registration. Octopus Network is an Appchain network running on the NEAR blockchain network, so Appchain team needs to have an account on the NEAR network, and registering Appchain needs to bond OCT.

The easiest way to create an account on NEAR is to use the NEAR wallet. For more details, please refer to [Create NEAR Account](https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/basics/create-account).

If it is a testnet, you can open NEAR [testnet wallet link](https://wallet.testnet.near.org) and follow the instructions to create an account. Appchain team can join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/6GTJBkZA9Q) of Octopus. In the **#testnet** channel, apply for OCT for testing, and team members will help you.

The operation steps of Appchain registration are as follows:

1. Log in to Octopus Network with NEAR account, [Testnet](https://testnet.oct.network/).
2. Click the **Appchain** button, enter *Appchain ID, Bond Token*, and the Github link containing the *chainspec* file;
3. Click *Register* to send the registration transaction.

Appchain ID, 3-20 characters consisting of numbers and uppercase and lowercase letters.
