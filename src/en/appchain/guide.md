In this tutorial, we will learn and practice how to connect your Appchain to the Octopus network.

**What you will be doing**

Before we even get started, let's lay out what Appchain team is going to do over the course of this tutorial.

2. [Integrate your Appchain](./integrate.md)
3. [Release your Appchain](./release.md)
4. [Register your Appchain](./register.md)
