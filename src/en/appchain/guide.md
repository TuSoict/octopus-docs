## Appchain Guide

In this tutorial, we will learn and practice how to connect your Appchain to the Octopus network.

**What you will be doing**

Before we even get started, let's lay out what we are going to do over the course of this tutorial. We will:

1. [Register your Appchain](./register.md)
2. [Integrate your Appchain](./integrate.md)


Finally, to start the network, you can contact the Octopus team on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/6GTJBkZA9Q) #testnet channel of the Octopus network.
