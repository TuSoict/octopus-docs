## Develop your Appchain

Build your application-specific blockchain with the [Substrate]((https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/)) framework.

You also could develop Appchain based on the [Substrate minimal template] (https://github.com/octopus-network/barnacle/tree/minimal-template) which is provided by Octopus Network. And then you would create and implement your Runtime with application-specific business logic, compile your Runtime into an executable Wasm file, finally deploy it and connect to the Octopus network as an Appchain.
