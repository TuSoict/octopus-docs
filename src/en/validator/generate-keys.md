## Generate validator account

Each validator who wants to join the Appchain validator sets should generate their own Appchain account. This section provides several options for generating account, and each participant only needs to choose one such option. Regardless of which option you choose, be sure to record all of the output from this section as you will need it later.

Appchain is developed based on the Substrate, so there are the same ways to generate a Appchain account like any Sustrate-based chain (e.g. Polkadot).

* Polkadot{.js} Browser Plugin **RECOMMENDED FOR MOST USERS**
* Subkey **ADVANCED and MOST SECURE**

### Option 1: Polkadot{.js} Browser Plugin

The Polkadot{.js} Browser Plugin is a simple tool for managing accounts in a browser extension and allowing the signing of extrinsics using these accounts.

To generate your Appchain account with the [Polkadot{.js} Browser Plugin](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-account-generation#polkadotjs-browser-plugin).

### Option 2: Subkey

Subkey is a commandline utility included with Substrate that generates or restores Substrate keys. It is recommended for technically advanced users who are comfortable with the command line and compiling Rust code, and it is not recommended for general users.

For detailed build and usage instructions of subkey, please see [here](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/bin/utils/subkey).
