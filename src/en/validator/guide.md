**What you will be doing**

Before we even get started, let's lay out what we are going to do over the course of this tutorial. We will:

1. [Generate validator account](./generate-keys.md)
2. [Deploy validator node](./deploy-validator.md)
3. [Set Session key](./set-session-key.md)
4. [Stake OCT](./stake.md)
