## Appchain Pipeline

The Appchain startup process as below:

![Appchain_Pipeline](./appchain_pipeline.png)

* After completing [Register your Appchain](./register.md), the process goes through **Auditing**. Appchain team should send an email to the Octopus team (appchain@oct.network) for auditing. 
* After Appchain's code and the ChainSpec file in its release have passed the review, the process goes through **InQueue**, which OCT holders would vote on whether Appchain goes into the next phase. 
* If the Appchain was approved, the process goes through **Staging**, only one Appchain at a time will be staged, and then OCT holders who want to be a [validator](../validator/guide.md) of this Appchain could stake their OCTs for the Appchain. 
* When there are enough validators and staked OCTs, the Octopus team would stake several validators as bootnodes to start Appchain network, the process goes through **Booting**, which Appchain would produce blocks and new validators would be welcome.
