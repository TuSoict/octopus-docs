## EVM compatibility Appchain

The [Barnacle EVM](https://github.com/octopus-network/barnacle/tree/release-v0.9.13-evm) is development templates for the EVM compatibility appchain in the Octopus Network.

It uses the [Frontier](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier) developed by Parity, and its functionality is basically the same as [Moonbeam Network](https://moonbeam.network/).

Also, the Barnacle EVM appchain is **Booting** in the [Octopus Testnet](https://testnet.oct.network/appchains) and be launched soon, which supports the developer to deploy the DApp written by Solidity. How to deploy the DApps? Please refer to the [tutorials](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/build/eth-api/) from the Moonbeam Docs.
