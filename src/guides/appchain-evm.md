## EVM compatibility Appchain

The [Barnacle EVM](https://github.com/octopus-network/barnacle/tree/release-v0.9.13-evm) is an EVM-compatible appchain development template provided by Octopus Network. It uses the [Frontier](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier) developed by Parity, and its functionality is basically the same as [Moonbeam Network](https://moonbeam.network/).

The developer team can use this template to develop an EVM compatibility appchain, and it supports the team directly deploying their DApp written by Solidity as an appchain running in the Octopus Network. The appchain benefit from being an autonomous blockchain, and also, it obtains what [Octopus Network](https://oct.network/) provides flexible leased security, out-of-the-box interoperability, rich infrastructure services, and an active community.

How to deploy the DApps? Please refer to the [tutorials](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/build/eth-api/) from the Moonbeam Docs.

BTW: the Barnacle EVM appchain is **Running** in the [Octopus Testnet](https://testnet.oct.network/appchains).
