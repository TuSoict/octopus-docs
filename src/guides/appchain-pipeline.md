## Appchain Startup Pipeline

![Appchain_Pipeline](./appchain_pipeline.png)

* After completing the [Appchain registration](./appchain-register.md), the first phase in the startup pipeline is **Auditing**. Appchain team should have sent an email to the Octopus team (appchain@oct.network) for auditing in the last step of registration. 
* Once Appchain's code and the ChainSpec file in its release are audited, the next phase is **InQueue**, during which OCT holders would [vote](./voting-appchain.md) to decide whether Appchain would be promoted into the next phase. 
* After passing the **InQueue**, the Appchain would be in **Staging**. Only one Appchain at a time can be staged, and then OCT holders who want to be [validator](../maintain/validator-guide.md)s of the Appchain can stake their OCTs for the Appchain. 
* When there are enough validators and staked OCTs, the Octopus team would start several validator nodes as bootnodes to start the Appchain network, then phase comes to **Booting**, in which the Appchain would produce blocks and be ready for new validators to join.
