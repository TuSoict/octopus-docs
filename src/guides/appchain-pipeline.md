## Appchain Startup Pipeline

![Appchain_Pipeline](./appchain_pipeline.png)

* After completing the Appchain registration, the first phase in the startup pipeline is **Auditing**. Appchain team should have sent an email to the Octopus team (appchain@oct.network) for auditing in the last step of registration. 
* Once Appchain's code and the ChainSpec file in its release are audited, the next phase is **InQueue**, during which OCT holders would vote to decide whether Appchain would be promoted into the next phase. 
* After passing the **InQueue**, the Appchain would be in **Staging**. Only one Appchain at a time can be staged, and then OCT holders who want to be [validator](../maintain/validator-guide.md)s of the Appchain can stake their OCTs for the Appchain. 
* When there are enough validators and staked OCTs, the Octopus team would start several validator nodes as bootnodes to start the Appchain network, then phase comes to **Booting**, in which the Appchain would produce blocks and be ready for new validators to join.

### Voting for Appchain

For the Appchains in the **InQueue**, all OCT holders could upvote or downvote an apphain, the Appchain which gets the highest scores would be promoted into the **Staging** phase. The voting steps are as follows:

1. Log in to the [Octopus testnet](https://testnet.oct.network/) via a NEAR account.
2. Navigate to the **Appchains** page and select an Appchain in the **InQueue**, and then click it.
3. Click **Upvote** or **Downvote** and deposit a certain amount of â€‹OCTs for voting the Appchain. The more OCT amount you are willing to deposit, the stronger your vote will be weighted. Also, you could withdraw your OCTs anytime by clicking the **â€”**.
