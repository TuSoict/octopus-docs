## Voting for Appchain

For the Appchains in the **InQueue**, all OCT holders could upvote or downvote an apphain, the Appchain which gets the highest scores would be promoted into the **Staging** phase. The voting steps are as follows:

1. Log in to the [Octopus testnet](https://testnet.oct.network/) via a NEAR account.
2. Navigate to the **Appchains** page and select an Appchain in the **InQueue**, and then click it.
3. Click **Upvote** or **Downvote** and deposit a certain amount of ​OCTs for voting the Appchain. The more OCT amount you are willing to deposit, the stronger your vote will be weighted. Also, you could withdraw your OCTs anytime by clicking the **—**.
