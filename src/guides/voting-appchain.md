## Voting for Appchain

For the Appchains in the **Voting**, all OCT holders could upvote or downvote an apphain, the Appchain which gets the highest scores would be promoted into the **Staking** phase. The voting steps are as follows:

1. Log in to the [Octopus Mainnet](https://mainnet.oct.network) via a NEAR account.
2. Navigate to the **Appchains** page and select an Appchain in the **Voting**, and then click it.
3. Click **Upvote** or **Downvote** and deposit a certain amount of â€‹OCTs for voting the Appchain. The more OCT amount you are willing to deposit, the stronger your vote will be weighted. Also, you could withdraw your OCTs anytime by **Withdraw**. 

> Notes:
> Every day around 00:00 UTC, the admin of the Octopus Network team will count the number of votes in the appchain. The score for the day is the number of Upvotes minus the number of Downvotes. The total vote score is the sum of the accumulated scores for each day.
> To keep Upvote/Downvote, you must keep OCT deposited until the Voting stage ended for the Appchain.
